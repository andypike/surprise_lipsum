Surprise Lipsum
===============

Insipred by James Young and his blog post http://www.welcomebrand.co.uk/thoughts/surprise-lipsum/

Usage
=====

1. Include the surprise_ipsum.js script
2. Add the content ```[lipsum 100w 50%]``` to any element. 

This will generate some lorem ipsum text for you. In this example the ideal length is 100 words but will vary +/- 50% of the ideal. Therefore the text generated will be between 50 and 150 words.

Take a look at ```usage.html``` for an example.

Warning
=======

This is just a proof of concept. If you like it, I'll spend some more time on it and add some tests etc.
